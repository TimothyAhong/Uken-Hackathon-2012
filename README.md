    * If you have a tile that you would like to place click the tile in your hand and then click the spot where you would like to put it
    * If you are out of tiles, have no tiles you would like to place or have no tiles that can be placed then select draw new tiles (this will skip your current turn)

Whats up with these codes?
--------------------------------

A full suite of hip new fangled technologies were used when developing Warrior O's. Lets break it down:
* [Meteor](https://meteor.com)
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org)
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)
* [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com)
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)

###### Server and framework
Warrior O's rests within the MeteorJS framework. Through Meteor we have used coffeescript for the server and client side code. Styling has been with basic CSS and templating with HTML with handlebars

###### Graphics and visuals
For the motion graphics we used KineticJS, a lightweight graphics framework that utilizes HTML5 canvas. KineticJS has a simple sprite management system that was very usefull. For the board we used straight up HTML tables (with help from bootstrap) and CSS

###### But will it scale?
Unlikely...
You could probably bring the free server to its knees with a dozen or so concurrent games

###### But is it secure?
Heck no!
